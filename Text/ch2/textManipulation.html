            <h1>String Methods</h1>
            <p class="f4 lh-copy">We can do a lot with character, words and sentences. Once they are made into variables 
                inside programs. These variables are called Objects or Class of Objects. The text based data is called Strings.
                Strings in javascript have lot of features (called methods) which you <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String">refer here.</a>
            </p>
            <p>Provide a text file below. (one that has .txt extension)</p>
            <div id="textCont"></div>
            <div class="fl w-50 f4 tl">
                <p class="lh-copy w-50">Number of Words: <span id="length"></span></p>
                <p class="lh-copy w-50">Number of letters: <span id="charLen"></span></p>
                <p class="lh-copy bg-red black" id="error"></p>
            </div>
            <p class="lh-copy">P5 uses the OOP to attach the elements to the correct 
                location in the DOM. Say you want to know if a word is inside the file 
            you have uploaded, and display the sentence it contains</p>
            <div class="fl w-50 f4 tl">
                <textarea name="searchArea" id="search" cols="20" rows="2">Enter Search word</textarea>
                <p class="lh-copy bg-yellow red" id="senOut"></p>
            </div>
            <p>P5.js library makes the process of getting the text file very easy.  
                manipulating the strings and providing outputs simpler. P5 like JQuery 
                gives enough control over the DOM elements and allows a range of 
                features to work with. Below are some more implementation of text manipulation
                with P5.

            <h1>N+7 Word Swapper</h1>
            <p class="f4 lh-copy">Nouns are all around us. Animate or inanimate, they are there in form of things, places, items, trinkets and the list goes on. The challenge is to 
                find the noun in a given text and replace that noun with 7th one following in the dictionary. Provide the text that you want the 
                nouns to be replaced. You can select the file, copy the contents or just drag the file below.

                <h3>Problem and Step Solution</h3>
                <ul class="lh-copy f4">
                    <li>Multiple ways of getting the text inputs needs to be coded.3 different methods 
                        copy pasting the text, selecting the file by browsing and dragging and dropping the 
                        file is implemented.
                    </li>
                    <li>Visual cues are given once the file data is recieved. When the file is dropped in the 
                        the drop area, the area color highlights. Similarly, when the text is entered, it start 
                        appearing in the "Your content area"
                    </li>
                    <li>Recieved data needs to be split, and nouns needs to be identified.In production environment,
                        I will use more robust API to check whether a word is a noun, but during practice I decided to 
                        use wordlist of nouns in the internet. <a href="http://ashley-bovan.co.uk/">Ashley Bovan's</a> and 
                        <a href="http://xaviershay.github.io/mnemonicker-wordlist/">xaviershay's</a> list came very handy
                    </li>
                    <li>Need to locate the 7th word after the identified noun in the english dictionary.
                        For this git hub repo <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwyl/english-words/master/words_dictionary.json">by dwyl</a> is imported.
                        However in the example, I have just indexed ahead inside the "nouns" list itself.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        After find the 7th word, that is word is replaced for all the occurences the text that is 
                        provided by the user. 
                    </li>
                    <li>As addition, the nouns that are replaced are highlighted blue in the source File
                        and highlighted orange in changed content.
                    </li>
                    <li> <strong>Do not pull files that ranges in multiple MBs,</strong> it will literally slowdown the 
                        user experience. Even with asynchronous operation, the browser can only handle limited process
                    </li>
