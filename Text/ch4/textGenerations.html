                <strong>No.</strong>They cannot. But they can write out words in evocative and emotional ways that will make us mere 
                writers, poets and avid readers that Computers can tell stories. Curiosity is the only medicine for the ills of ignorance.
                I started Exploring the multiple text generation libraries with help of the <a href="https://thecodingtrain.com/">Coding Train</a> youtube videos
                <ul>
                    <li>RiTa <a href="https://rednoise.org/rita/">Daniel Howe</a></li>
                    <li>Compromise Cool <a href="https://compromise.cool/">Spencer Mountain</a></li>

            <h3>Why L1?</h3>
            <p class="f4 lh-copy">
                The text generation codes are written as <strong>function inside libraries</strong> by programmers. The generation through such a function is Level 1.
                The next is using <strong> Deep Learning </strong>Transformer models that is trained on millions of texts on the internet, and from the book. 
                Then there is L3, which is <strong>artificial intelligence</strong> that writes to win the maximum resource or such sconres.

            <h1>Generation Activities</h1>
            <p class="lh-copy f4">Each library listed above has its benefits and shortcomings. The data structure it offers, the depth of lexicon data it has, and the 
                type of Activities it allows one to perform is some time unique. I prefer to have the text that is analysed on the page so it will be 
                easier to see the <strong>raw material</strong> on which the libraries are acting upon.

                    He said, “In all human history, no other intelligence has impinged on us, to our knowledge. This need only continue a few more centuries, perhaps little more than one ten thousandth of the time civilization has already existed, and we will be safe. After all,” and here Trevize felt a sudden twinge of trouble, which he forced himself to disregard, “it is not as though we had the enemy already here and among us.”
