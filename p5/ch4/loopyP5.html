          <h1>Conditional P5</h1>
          <p class="f4 lh-copy">While animating there is a challenge of the character, shape leaving the screen 
            and never returning back, because of their coordinates. We have this problem in the animation shown 
            below.

            How to make it turn back? Enter the conditional expression in P5. These expression are 
            used in the same way as Javascript. The above visual will have a ball bouncing of the walls  
            kind of the action shown below. This was done with two if statements, which can be done with single 
            conditional by using || like below
            <pre><code>if(xCoord > width || xCoord < 0){
        speed = speed * -1
      }</code></pre>
          </p>

            Another ways to change the flow is modifying what is shown to the viewer. Like below shapes and their
          fills are modified depending where the mouse is. These changes are initiated by using simple reference 
        numbers on the canvas.More sophisticated logic will be implemented by nesting or chaining these conditionals.</p>

            Else-If statement evaluates the first true statement and moves out of the loop. This creates difficult 
            situation when trying to measure the variable with respect to a series of number ranges. What happens if 
            the else-if is not used...

          <p class="f4 lh-copy">When "Else-if logic is used you see something different. Shapes get removed 
            from the canvas.

          <p class="f4 lh-copy">There is more to conditional logic which will be taken up in another page, different
            set of visuals. Some of the exercises to try are, programming rollover, button click. These will be explored
            and shared here.
