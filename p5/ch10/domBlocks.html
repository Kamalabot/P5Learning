            that is superimposed. This page can have all the headings colored green and para with blue in one version. In other version
            the headings are purple and the para are orange.

          <h1>Power of Selectors</h1>
          <p class="f4 lh-copy">There are many directions in which the code execution can be directed. Finally the state of 
            something needs to be changed. That is the evidence that code as <strong>acted upon</strong> and the behaviour 
            has changed.

          <p class="f4 lh-copy">
            P5 recognises the CSS style selectors and attributes. This page has 3 states, where no 
            color is applied. Two other states the color of the elements dynamically changes between 
            two states.

            classes that is already hard coded in creating this page. The P5 code is not having the ability to remove those classes 
            out of the page.
