          <h1>Shapes or Story</h1>
          <p class="f4 lh-copy">What you see below? Shapes or the character. If you said, a character that is colored ridiculously.
            An art piece in museum, most likely. If you inspected (shift + ctrl + I) the shapes, there will be no DOM elements but 
            just a canvas. Where are these shapes coming from?
          </p>
          <p class="f4 lh-copy">
            P5 is playing with these shapes though the scripts running on this page, on your browser. Like the ghost in the machine. 
            We see not just shapes, but colors and some of the shapes are transparent. There are many options for the shapes, and the colors 
            that were explored, and the below figure was drawn.
          </p>
          <p>Guess how many lines of code it took. 20 lines of code, and another thousand lines of support code from p5.js library.</p>
