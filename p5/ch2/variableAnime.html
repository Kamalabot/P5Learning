          <p class="f4 lh-copy">Computers are meant for expressing the concepts that are moving and creating 
            patterns, finding optimum solution and repetitive tasks. It is not meant for static image like

            Lets animate the things on the canvas. To animate the draw function plays a vital role. Because it is 
            function that is <strong>Forever in loop.</strong> Anything that is put in there is 
            created again and again.

        <h1>Variables in P5</h1>
        <p class="f4 lh-copy">Starting by <strong>Declaring</strong>, <strong>Initialize</strong> and then <strong>Use.</strong>
          Declaring is done at the top of the P5 code. Then initialising can happen either at 
          setup function or draw function. 
          Things have slowed down because the frameRate has been reduced to 25. Why the circle is moving continuosly 
          away from the place it start? 
          <strong>Take your mouse on the canvas and give a click</strong>

        <p class="f4 lh-copy">There is more to P5 than it meets the eyes. <strong>Map</strong> function that converts a 
          particular range of values to a different range and assigns it to a variable. <strong>Random</strong> function 
          returns a number between two values. These two functions are used in below visual...

        <p>The radius of circle is fluctuating due to the random() function, and try changing the location of the mouse 
          and observe the color of the background change. That change is created by the map function. 
          It opens up to interesting outcomes....
