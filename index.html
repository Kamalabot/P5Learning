                  <p class="f4 lh-copy">Before I got into the Javascript ride I would have thought, in months. Now, it is matter of hours. It all boils down 
                    to <strong>Putting your Fingers on the Keyboard.</strong> Programming is about text and pictures in the internet, 
                    and placing these things on interesting places on the web page.  
                  </p>
                  <p class="f4 lh-copy">The pages in this website/blog/training ground will contain the trials I under take in three different 
                    but inter-linked domains.

                  <p class="f4 lh-copy">All the technology today is geared towards finding the patterns in actions and things that human make, 
                    interact, and want. Humans can talk, write, draw, act, and finally show to the world what they want. That is where JS, ML5 and P5
                    all come together. I hope to enjoy every bit of the concept that I am going to learn and experiment with.
