                Camera is available everywhere today. On top of it, classifying algorithms are looking it 
                millions of images and becoming smarter and accurate. Can we make the browser smarter? 
                We will get to it.

                Wondering why you are not classified by your name. Because the MobileNet model is not trained with 
                your image. But other images that you can find under the <a href="https://tfhub.dev/google/imagenet/mobilenet_v2_050_160/feature_vector/5">TF Hub</a>
                from where the ml5 team is pulling the model. The way to get you classified by your name, a lot of pictures of 
                yourself is required for training the model. That is going to handled in a seperate page soon.
