                We want the browser to findout what the image file contains. If you think a human, like the programmer can find out by opening the image file 
                then you should leave. But...If you want the computer to do it for not one, or two but for a million images without complaining, then we will 
                see how it is done.  
            </p>
            <p class="f4 lh-copy">We have the image loaded into the DOM and classified by ML5 with the results shown below. But where?? 
                It will populate in a moment, as the model is working in the background and getting the results.
